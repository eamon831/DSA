I see what you're asking for now! Let's go step by step, keeping **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** and **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** separate but still relate them in a way that flows naturally.

---

### **1. Wrong Example (Before Refactoring):**

```dart

class AreaCalculator {
  double calculateArea(List<Object> shapes) {
    double area = 0;
    for (final shape in shapes) {
      if (shape is Square) {
        area += shape.area();
      } else if (shape is Circle) {
        area += shape.area();
      }
    }
    return area;
  }

  String json(List<Object> shapes) {
    return 'sum: ${calculateArea(shapes)}';
  }

  String csv(List<Object> shapes) {
    return 'sum,${calculateArea(shapes)}';
  }
}

class Square {
  final double side;

  Square(this.side);

  double area() {
    return side * side;
  }
}

class Circle {
  final double radius;

  Circle(this.radius);

  double area() {
    return radius * radius * 3.14;
  }
}
```

#### **What’s wrong here?**
- The `AreaCalculator` class violates **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** and **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**.

---

### **2. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** Violation Explanation:**

#### **Problem**:
The `AreaCalculator` class handles two different responsibilities:
1. **Calculating areas** of different shapes.
2. **Formatting results** (JSON, CSV).

#### **Violation of SRP**:
- **SRP** says that a class should have **one reason to change**. But in this case, if you need to change how the area is calculated or if you want to modify the way data is formatted (e.g., add a new output format), you would need to change the `AreaCalculator` class, which is not ideal.

#### **Effect**:
- The class becomes **less flexible** because a change in one area (e.g., changing the output format from CSV to XML) forces you to touch the logic responsible for calculations as well. It creates unnecessary dependencies between unrelated parts of the code.

---

### **3. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** Violation Explanation:**

#### **Problem**:
- If you add a new shape (e.g., `Triangle`), you would need to modify the `AreaCalculator` class to account for the new shape, which violates **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**.

#### **Violation of OCP**:
- **OCP** dictates that a class should be **open for extension** but **closed for modification**. This means you should be able to add new behavior (like a new shape) **without modifying** the existing classes (like `AreaCalculator`).

#### **Effect**:
- To support a new shape, the `AreaCalculator` class has to be modified every time, which leads to **code duplication** and **increased complexity** over time.

---

### **4. Refactored Example (Fixing SRP and OCP)**

---

#### **Refactoring for SRP:**

```dart
// Abstract Shape class - Open for Extension, Closed for Modification
abstract class Shape {
  double area();
}

class Circle implements Shape {
  final double radius;

  Circle(this.radius);

  @override
  double area() {
    return radius * radius * 3.14; // Simple approximation for π
  }
}

class Square implements Shape {
  final double side;

  Square(this.side);

  @override
  double area() {
    return side * side;
  }
}

// AreaCalculator responsible only for area calculation
class AreaCalculator {
  double calculateArea(List<Shape> shapes) {
    double area = 0;
    for (final shape in shapes) {
      area += shape.area();
    }
    return area;
  }
}

// AreaPrinter responsible for formatting the result in different formats
class AreaPrinter {
  String json(double area) {
    return 'sum: $area';
  }

  String csv(double area) {
    return 'sum,$area';
  }
}
```

---

### **5. Explanation of Refactored Code:**

#### **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**

**Solution**:
- **`AreaCalculator`** now only calculates the area, which is its **one responsibility**.
- **`AreaPrinter`** now only handles the formatting logic (JSON, CSV), so it has its **own responsibility**.

**Benefit**:
- The system is now **easier to maintain** because you can modify the **calculation logic** without affecting the **formatting logic**, and vice versa.
- This separation ensures that a change in one area doesn’t inadvertently break or require changes in the other area.

#### **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):**

**Solution**:
- The **`Shape` interface** allows new shapes to be added without changing the `AreaCalculator` or `AreaPrinter` classes.
- For example, if you wanted to add a `Triangle` shape, you would create a new class that implements `Shape`, and **nothing else** needs to be modified.

**Benefit**:
- The system is now **open for extension** (you can add new shapes like `Triangle`, `Rectangle`, etc.) but **closed for modification** (you don’t need to touch the existing `AreaCalculator` or `AreaPrinter` classes).
- This reduces the risk of introducing bugs and makes the code more **scalable** as your system grows.

---

### **6. Future Benefits of Refactored Code**

- **Easy to Add New Shapes**: If you need to support a new shape (e.g., `Triangle` or `Rectangle`), just implement the `Shape` interface, and the system will work with the new shape automatically without touching the core logic.
- **Easy to Add New Formats**: If you need to print the area in a new format (e.g., `XML`), you can create a new class (e.g., `XmlPrinter`) without changing the `AreaCalculator`.
- **Better Maintainability**: With clearly separated responsibilities, you can easily manage and test the `AreaCalculator` and `AreaPrinter` independently. Each class has **one reason to change**, and changes to one part of the system don’t impact other parts unnecessarily.

---

### **7. Recap:**

- **Before Refactoring**: The `AreaCalculator` violated both **SRP** and **OCP**. It had multiple responsibilities and needed modification every time a new shape was added.
- **After Refactoring**: We adhered to both **SRP** and **OCP**:
    1. **SRP**: We separated the **calculation logic** and **formatting logic** into separate classes.
    2. **OCP**: We allowed new shapes to be added without changing the `AreaCalculator` class.

This approach ensures the system is **extensible**, **maintainable**, and **flexible**, adhering to both the **Single Responsibility Principle** and the **Open/Closed Principle**.
